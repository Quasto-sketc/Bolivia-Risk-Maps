This project involves a comprehensive analysis of natural phenomena like droughts, floods, and frosts, which significantly impact societal activities and infrastructure (Sun et al. 2020). Droughts, typified by extended periods of water scarcity due to reduced rainfall, are globally acknowledged for their detrimental economic consequences, resulting in widespread agricultural losses and livestock fatalities.
